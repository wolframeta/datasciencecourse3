The aim of this course project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

run_analysis.R (How the script works)

Create a folder called 'dataproject' inside your working directory.
Extract the zipped data fodler provided for this project to this 'dataproject' folder.
The path for your work files will be "./dataproject/UCI HAR Dataset/......"
Open the run_analysis.R file in RStudio or R.
Select the entire code and hit Ctrl+enter.
The averages dataset is your desired output.
A text version of the averages dataset will automatically be saved in your working directory.
