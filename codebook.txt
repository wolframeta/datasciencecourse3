Datasets used in the run_analysis.R file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
X_test = 2947 observations of 561 variables that capture the results of test for a fraction of the 30 subjects
Y_test = 2947 observations of 1 variable that captures the activity performed by each test subject
X_train = 7352 observations of 561 variables that capture the results of training for a fraction of the 30 subjects
Y_train = 7352 observations of 1 variable that captures the activity performed by each training subject
activity_labels = 6 observations of 2 variables providing the number and the activity associated with it
features = 561 observations of the types of each of the X_test and X_train variables
 
DF_test = data frame of test variables and observations
DF_train = data frame of the training variables and observations

DF = merged data frame of DF_test and DF_train
DF_trim = trimmed version of the DF data frame, with only columns that contain mean and std variables

averages = 180 observations of 68 variables that provide the calculated averages for each observation in the DF_trim data frame
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables in the averages.txt file

subject - the umber for each of the 30 subjects
activity - the activity performed by the subject
